## üëã Hello there!

I'm Ignacio Alonso L√≥pez-Linares, a consultant specializing in Data Analytics and AI. 
I am currently based in Madrid, Spain. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## üöÄ About Me

I am passionate about bringing data and business together by creating innovative solutions. 
My journey starts at 13 years old when I received my first computer:
- Initially, I became interested in pen-testing, cybersecurity, and rooting phones. Later, I learned a bit about graphic design on Adobe Suite and video-editing.
- At age 18, I started Business Administration with a specialization in Finance at Comillas.
- At age 21, at the University of Michigan and as an exchange student, I learned R and how to use data science and apply it to organizations to solve problems
- That summer, I began working at PwC where I was involved in many financial due diligence processes.
- Upon graduation, I won an award for the Best Data Science project, which discussed more efficient methods using clustering to organize bikes in Madrid's Bike Rental System, BiciMAD.
- After ending my degree, I started at Accenture where I worked for media and telecom companies automating and deploying dashboards using Google Cloud Platform.
- Now, I am a student at IE's School of Science and Technology. We always can learn something more ;D
